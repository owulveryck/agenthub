# AgentHub Documentation

Welcome to the AgentHub documentation! This comprehensive guide will help you understand, install, and use the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol-compliant communication broker to build sophisticated multi-agent systems with Event-Driven Architecture scalability.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### New to AgentHub?
Start with our [Installation and Setup](tutorials/installation_and_setup/) tutorial, then follow the [Running the Demo](tutorials/run_demo/) guide to see AgentHub in action.

### Want to understand the concepts?
Read about [The Agent2Agent Principle](explanation/the_agent_to_agent_principle/) to understand the philosophy behind AgentHub.

### Ready to build agents?
Use our guides to [Create a Publisher](howto/create_publisher/) or [Create a Subscriber](howto/create_subscriber/).

### Need technical details?
Check the [API Reference](reference/api_reference/) and [Configuration Reference](reference/configuration_reference/).

## üìö Documentation Types

## üîß System Overview

AgentHub enables autonomous agents to collaborate through A2A protocol-compliant task delegation with EDA scalability:

- **A2A Protocol Compliance** with standardized Message, Task, and Artifact formats
- **Event-Driven Architecture** for scalable asynchronous communication
- **Flexible agent addressing** (direct, broadcast, topic-based routing)
- **Rich task semantics** with A2A lifecycle states and priorities
- **Built-in resilience** with EDA patterns and graceful failure handling
- **Comprehensive observability** with distributed tracing and metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

- **Protocol**: gRPC with Protocol Buffers
- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Architecture**: Event-driven with pub/sub patterns
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration
- **Message Format**: Structured protobuf with flexible JSON parameters
