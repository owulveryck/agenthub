# Explanations

This section provides in-depth discussions and explanations to help you understand the concepts, design decisions, and architecture behind AgentHub. These materials are designed to broaden your understanding beyond just how to use the system.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **[The Agent2Agent Principle](the_agent_to_agent_principle/)** - Philosophy and design principles
- **[Understanding Tasks](the_tasks/)** - Task semantics, lifecycle, and patterns
- **[Unified Abstraction Library](unified_abstraction_library/)** - High-level abstraction design

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

- **[Broker Architecture](broker_architecture/)** - Internal design and trade-offs
- **[Performance and Scaling](performance_and_scaling/)** - Performance characteristics and strategies
- **[Distributed Tracing](distributed_tracing/)** - Observability architecture

## 🔧 Implementation Details

- **[Go Build Tags](go_build_tags/)** - Build system and feature flags

## 🎯 How to Use These Explanations

These documents are designed to:
- **Provide context** for why things work the way they do
