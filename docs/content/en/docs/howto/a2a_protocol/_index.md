# Agent2Agent Protocol How-To Guides

This section provides practical guides for working with the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol in AgentHub. These guides show you how to implement A2A-compliant communication patterns for building robust agent systems.

## Available Guides

### [Working with A2A Messages](work_with_a2a_messages/)
Learn how to create, structure, and process A2A messages with text, data, and file content parts. This is the foundation for all A2A communication.

### [Working with A2A Conversation Context](work_with_conversation_context/)
Understand how to manage conversation contexts for multi-turn interactions, workflow coordination, and state preservation across agent communications.

### [Working with A2A Artifacts](work_with_a2a_artifacts/)
Master the creation and handling of A2A artifacts - structured outputs that deliver rich results from completed tasks.

### [Working with A2A Task Lifecycle](work_with_task_lifecycle/)
Learn how to manage the complete task lifecycle from creation through completion, including state transitions, progress updates, and error handling.

## A2A Protocol Benefits

The Agent2Agent protocol provides:

- **Structured Communication**: Standardized message formats with rich content types
- **Conversation Threading**: Context-aware message grouping for complex workflows
- **Rich Artifacts**: Structured outputs with multiple content types
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete task state tracking from submission to completion
- **Interoperability**: Standards-based communication for multi-vendor agent systems

## Prerequisites

Before following these guides:

1. Complete the [Installation and Setup](../../tutorials/getting-started/installation_and_setup/) tutorial
2. Run the [AgentHub Demo](../../tutorials/getting-started/run_demo/) to see A2A in action
3. Understand the [Agent2Agent Principle](../../explanation/concepts/the_agent_to_agent_principle/)

## Implementation Approach

These guides use AgentHub's unified abstractions from `internal/agenthub` which provide:

- **A2ATaskPublisher**: Simplified A2A task creation and publishing
- **A2ATaskSubscriber**: Streamlined A2A task processing and response generation
- **Automatic Observability**: Built-in tracing, metrics, and logging
- **Environment Configuration**: Zero-config setup with environment variables

Start with the [A2A Messages guide](work_with_a2a_messages/) to learn the fundamentals, then progress through the other guides to build complete A2A-compliant agent systems.
