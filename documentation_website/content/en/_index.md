<p class="lead mt-5">A unified abstraction library enabling autonomous agents to collaborate through structured task delegation</p>
{{< blocks/link-down color="info" >}}
{{< /blocks/cover >}}


{{% blocks/lead color="primary" %}}
AgentHub is a unified abstraction library that enables autonomous agents to collaborate by exchanging structured tasks through an Agent2Agent communication broker. It provides asynchronous task delegation, flexible agent addressing, and built-in resilience for building complex multi-agent systems.
{{% /blocks/lead %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-exchange-alt" title="Agent2Agent Communication" %}}
AgentHub implements the Agent2Agent principle, enabling agents to delegate tasks to each other asynchronously with built-in progress tracking and resilience.

Check the [Agent2Agent principle documentation](/docs/explanation/the_agent_to_agent_principle) for more details!

## Key Components
{.h1 .text-center}

AgentHub consists of a broker server, publisher agents, subscriber agents, and a unified abstraction library with comprehensive observability features.

{{% /blocks/section %}}

{{% blocks/section type="row" %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-server" title="Broker Server" %}}
The central communication hub that routes tasks between agents with built-in resilience and failure handling.

Uses gRPC with Protocol Buffers for efficient communication.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-paper-plane" title="Publisher Agents" %}}
Agents that create and delegate tasks to other agents, monitoring progress and receiving results.

Create your own with the [publisher guide](/docs/howto/create_publisher/).
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-inbox" title="Subscriber Agents" %}}
Agents that receive and process tasks from other agents, reporting progress and returning results.

Build subscribers using the [subscriber guide](/docs/howto/create_subscriber/).
